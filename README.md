## PREDATOR: Registration of 3D Point Clouds with Low Overlap
This repository provides code and data required to train and evaluate PREDATOR, a  model  for  **p**airwise point-cloud **re**gistration with **d**eep **at**tention to the **o**verlap **r**egion. It represents the official implementation of the paper:

## News
- 2021-02-23: Modelnet and KITTI release
- 2020-11-30: Code and paper release

## Instructions
This code has been tested on 
- Python 3.8.5, PyTorch 1.7.1, CUDA 11.2, gcc 9.3.0, GeForce RTX 3090/GeForce GTX 1080Ti

**Note**: We observe random data loader crashes due to memory issues, if you observe similar issues, please consider reducing the number of workers or increasing CPU RAM. We are working on releasing a sparse convolution-based Predator, stay tuned! 

### Requirements
To create a virtual environment and install the required dependences please run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ShengyuH/OverlapPredator.git
virtualenv predator; source predator/bin/activate
cd OverlapPredator; pip install -r requirements.txt
cd cpp_wrappers; sh compile_wrappers.sh; cd ..
```
in your working folder.
**Note**: For Python 3.8.5, please replace ```virtualenv --no-site-packages predator -p python3``` with ```virtualenv predator```. 

### Datasets and pretrained models
For KITTI dataset, please follow the instruction on [KITTI Odometry website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) to download the KITTI odometry training set.

We provide 
- preprocessed 3DMatch pairwise datasets (voxel-grid subsampled fragments together with their ground truth transformation matrices)
- modelnet dataset
- pretrained models on 3DMatch, KITTI and Modelnet

The preprocessed data and models can be downloaded by running:
```shell
sh scripts/download_data_weight.sh
```

Predator is the model evaluated in the paper whereas bigPredator is a wider network that is trained on a single GeForce RTX 3090. 

| Model       | first_feats_dim   | gnn_feats_dim | # parameters|
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Predator | 128               | 256 | 7.43M|
| bigPredator | 256                | 512 | 29.67M|

The results of both Predator and bigPredator, obtained using the evaluation protocol described in the paper, are available in the bottom table:

### 3DMatch(Indoor)
#### Train
After creating the virtual environment and downloading the datasets, Predator can be trained using:
```shell
python main.py configs/train/indoor.yaml
```

#### Evaluate
For 3DMatch, to reproduce Table 2 in our main paper, we first extract features and overlap/matachability scores by running: 
```shell
python main.py configs/test/indoor.yaml
```
the features will be saved to ```snapshot/indoor/3DMatch```. The estimation of the transformation parameters using RANSAC can then be carried out using:
```shell
for N_POINTS in 250 500 1000 2500 5000
do
  python scripts/evaluate_predator.py --source_path snapshot/indoor/3DMatch --n_points $N_POINTS --benchmark 3DMatch
done
```
dependent on ```n_points``` used by RANSAC, this might take a few minutes. The final results are stored in ```est_traj/{benchmark}/{n_points}/result```. To evaluate PREDATOR on 3DLoMatch benchmark, please also change ```3DMatch``` to ```3DLoMatch``` in ```configs/test/indoor.yaml```.

#### Demo
We prepared a small demo, which demonstrates the whole Predator pipeline using two random fragments from the 3DMatch dataset. To carry out the demo, please run:
```shell
python scripts/demo.py configs/test/indoor.yaml
```

The demo script will visualize input point clouds, inferred overlap regions, and point cloud aligned with the estimated transformation parameters:

### KITTI(Outdoor)
We provide a small script to evaluate Predator on KITTI test set, after configuring KITTI dataset, please run:
```
python main.py configs/test/kitti.yaml
```
the results will be saved to the log file.

### ModelNet(Synthetic)
We provide a small script to evaluate Predator on ModelNet test set, please run:
```
python main.py configs/test/modelnet.yaml
```
The rotation and translation errors could be better/worse than the reported ones due to randomness in RANSAC.
